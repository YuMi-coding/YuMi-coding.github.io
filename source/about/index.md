I am most interested in **Software-Defined Networking**, **Data center Networking** and network performance optimization, especially in enabling **virtual network functions** in SDNs and enhancing network throughput by adopting **in network computing techniques**. I have experience in developing network functions and hacking complex network systems.

## Education

### Ph.D. @ Case Western Reserve University

Aug. 2017 ~ Present

- **Research Areas**: Software-Defined Network, Data Center Network & Cybersecurity
- **Advisor**: Prof. An Wang

### B.A. @ Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications

Sep. 2013 ~ Jul. 2017

## Experience

### Research Assistant @ Case Western Reserve University

Jan. 2019 ~ Present

- Developed system to implement PushBack – DDoS defense in SDN centralized network. Including hacking OpenvSwitch, Ryu Controller platform and implementing control path signals, as well as machine learning techniques to cluster and find frequent flow patterns in the control plane. This system also allows control plane to throttle the suspicious flow pattern in order to protect the network from DDoS attack.
- Implementing Network Traffic Analysis system, to track user behavior under different network bandwidth and evaluate the contribution made by network infrastructure to user experience.
- Exploring the efficiency of ebpf systems in defending against DDoS attacks.

### Research Internship @ Nokia Bell Labs

Jun. 2021 ~ Aug. 2021

- Implemented an SRv6 platform using ebpf filters
- Exploring SRv6 feasibility in augmenting devices' mobility

### Research Internship @ Nokia Bell Labs

Jun. 2022 ~ Aug. 2022

- Designed an anchorless resolving platform
- Exploring VPP and DPDK feasibility in improving data plane processing

### Research Internship @ Nokia Bell Labs

Jun. 2023 ~ Aug. 2023

* Developed the platform for evaluating eBPF processing efficiency.
* Evaluated the eBPF modules with DPDK powered tools and synthetically generated traffic.
